  <h3>A tale as told by Steve</h3>

  <article>
    <p>
      Many moons ago, there was a boy. A boy who was relatively quiet, a little unsure of himself, and positively terrified of the real world. So far in life, this boy had managed to survive by focusing on one day at a time, never looking to or worrying about the future. The future, you see, was already written in stone. It was fairly simple: Graduate, get a kick-ass job, make bank, move to New Zealand. Completely foolproof, right?

      I know what you're thinking. How could a plan that makes so much sense possibly go wrong? Well despite his high opinion of himself, this boy didn't seem to be quite appealing to prospective employers. True, these were only internships he was applying to; but if no one would take him, how would he get real world experience? He begins to get nervous. Mass applications go out to any who would take them. Pyramid schemes begin to sound appealing...

      Then, finally, he receives an offer. The Disney College Program. An internship program where he'd have to take a semester off of school to sell merchandise for a company who may very well be ruling the world by the time I'm done writing this. How could he even have applied for this? This has no relevance to his education or his future! So how do you respond? Well, with the most improbable response possible: "<b>yes.</b>"

      Ladies and gentlemen, this is where the story begins. The boy in the preface, that was me. I know it's hard to believe that someone so strong, confident, handsome as I am could have been that person, had those doubts. But the truth can be surprising. And thus, we arrive in sunny Orlando, FL.

      My goals with this internship program were fairly simple: meet new people, experience new things, have some damn fun.
