  <h3>A tale as told by Steve</h3>
  <p>
    Alright friends, family - other people... Sit down and lean back because there's a story on the horizon!
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of you reading this know Candice and I. You probably even know a good deal about how we met. But do you know the whole story? I doubt it very much. You see, every decision we make in our lives, no matter how seemingly small, can have some profound impacts on our future. I'm a graduate of The Pennsylvania State Universities school of Computer Engineering. I spent 4 years there in good ol' Happy Valley, from 2008 to 2012. I learned a little, partied a litt... ok a lot, and I made experiences that will last a lifetime. There was one thing that I was severely lacking in though, real world experience. Many of friends were getting these mythical <i>internships</i> and those weird co-ops (what the hell even are those by the way?) and I'm going home each summer and doing whatever odd-end job I find.
  </p>
  </article>
  <article>
  <p>
    Fast-forward to 2011. I'm a junior, this is seemingly my last chance to get work experience prior to graduation, and I've got nothing. On a whim, I applied for the Disney College Program. I love Disney, sounded fun, better than sitting around Philadelphia all summer, delivering pizza. Wouldn't ya know, they call me back and offer me the internship? Sweet! Easy decision right? I'm betting what many people don't know, is that at the same time, I was being offered an engineering role with the United States Air Force. This was another whim, I had nothing on the horizon, I'd always considered it... why not? In typical US Military fashion (meaning no disrespect vets), they did their best to make it seem far too good to be true. And honestly, I wanted to do it. The only thing that scared me, was the prospect of constantly moving to places that I had no say in. I think it's needless to say that I went with Disney.
  </p>
  </article>
  <article>
  <p>
    So, was this the right choice? At the time, hell no. Career wise, the Air Force would have been far and away the better option. But I went with my gut. And that's how I ended up in the car with my parents, driving down to Orlando, FL in May of 2011. Show up for the first day on the program, check in to housing at Vista Way (the only way), go through our orientation, the works. I meet up with my roommates for the first time, some are pretty chill guys. One of which (MJ) says to us all, and I'll never forget this - "Goal of orientation is to make friends with as many girls as possible, so we can throw parties." Now I'm paraphrasing, but you get the idea. So here I am, thinking "Dammit... I need to get my game going and impress these guys."
  </p>

  <p>
    Skip to Downtown Disney orientation - I get there early, alone at a table, so I pull my phone out and start streaking for the cash (never won). Enter Candice. I look up, and this prowls on in through the door, lookin' fine as hell with that preppy strut in her step and her designer clothes. Looking around you can't help but think her presence alone is putting the rest of the room to shame. Then she sits down at my table, we say our hello's. And all I can think in the back of my head is "God, I already hate this girl."
  </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <p>
      Oh my God Steve - what are you doing to me? Love at first sight! Instant connection! All that jazz! <b>Grow up kids.</b> That's just not the way of the world sometimes. To be fair, we did spend much of that orientation hanging out. I almost wrote her off when she started droning on about her sorority (ugh, sorority girls), but the fact is - the rest of the class was distinctly uninteresting. So I persisted, thinking I can at least grab her number and accomplish what I set out to do. WRONG. We parted ways, I forget to ask, and I go home defeated.

      What happens next? Well you all know Facebook right? Social media giant, big in the news these days... That was a thing for me once upon a time. I log on and hey, who is the Candice girl friend requesting me? It IS her, how the hell did she find me considering I <i>never gave her my last name...</i> I know, super creepy right? True, but also a second chance for Steve! Pop open the messenger, hit her with the old school AIM game. It took mere minutes, and we were on the next bus to the parks together. Yeah, my AIM game is THAT good.
    </p>

  </article>
  <article>
    <p>
      I could tell you about how I almost missed that bus, but I'll save that story for another. We could detail all of our time together in Disney, but it would fill several books (and frankly, I've typed enough already). So I'm going to give you the short version - First (real) date we went to Italy (yes, in Epcot jerks), vacationed in Sanabel, spent 8 months together driving all over Orlando FL and taking advantage of our internship. We were broke as **** 20-somethings without a care in the world and loving every second of it.
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <p>
      But all good things must eventually end. See, come January 2012 - I had to return to school in State College, PA. Candice was going back home to Minneapolis, MN. So I did the only logical thing that someone in my position would do - broke up with her.
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <p>
      Actually - let me amend that statement. I <i>tried</i> to break up with her. I believe the exact reaction was for her to laugh in my face? It was a pretty surreal experience because nothing went as expected. I was so taken aback that I wasn't sure how to proceed. See, I was prepared for all the normal reactions. But you could never quite say Candice is normal. Next thing I know - I'm in a long (LONG!!!) distance relationship with a girl I've known less than a year.
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <p>
      Alright now - I'm going to fast forward one last time and get to the good parts. Before coming back to Florida - I had lived in Upstate New York, State College and Philadelphia. Candice floated between NYC, State College for a time, then Philadelphia as well. Despite the overlaps, we really didn't spend as much time living together as could be expected. Our relationship hits some trials and tribulations. There were definitely some rough bumps. Even after we made it back to Orlando.
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <p>
      But now we're here. We both grew up a <b>lot</b> during our time together. I'd been putting off something I'd known for a long, long time (mostly to piss off my Mom really). I was going to marry this girl. In fact, I subconsciously made this decision way back in the early days of our relationship when she pointed out a Disney wedding pin and said to me "is it weird if I kind of want to get that so that I'll have it when I get married?" Yeah I'm talking barely months into our relationship, and she says <i>that</i>. Everything I had learned in life said RUN NOW GET OUT QUICK. But my body wouldn't move. I stood there, awkwardly laughed, then when the shock wore off I filed that one away. Candice of course, in typical Candice fashion, completely forgot about that.
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <p>
      That's the reason it was so confusing to her when on September 11 (of all days) 2017, I handed her that pin. Then in the middle of Walt Disneys apartment, the man whom without him we'd never have even met, she was VERY confused when I dropped to my knee. Actually, it was kind of annoying how confused she was. "What are you doing?" "I just gave you a wedding pin and now I'm on my knee, fumbling with a box in my pocket. WHAT THE **** DO YOU THINK I'M DOING." She eventually caught on. She said yes. <i>I think she even cried.</i>
    </p>
  </article>
  <article>
    <p>
      I could go on in detail about any of these events, and hundreds of others that occurred through the course of our relationship. But these are the important ones. The ones that mean the most to me. The ones that stick out when I try to think of our story. It's not the vacations and the holidays. It's not us trying to out-do each other with extravagant gifts. It's those moments where the road splits, and you don't know which way leads to safety. Choosing Disney over the air force, choosing to ask her to the parks, keeping a long distance relationship (multiple freaking times I'll add), bringing her to State College, to Philly, even choosing to come back to Florida. Decisions that basically amounted to coin flips. And yet, here I am, writing this in the office of our home, where we intend to start our next story.

  <h3>A little something, something by Candice...</h3>

  <article><p>
    This story should start with once upon a time, since it occurs in the happiest place on earth, but of course real life doesn’t always work that way. Get ready to read my rambling tale of the last 7 years and how this happily ever after developed. 
  </p></article>

   <article><p>
   When I was about to graduate from Missouri State University I realized that I was not ready to grow up and be an adult. Finding a “real” job was a task that had simply been forgotten and moving back in with mom and dad seemed like the end of the world. Plan A, had always been get a job at the home office of a fashion corporation in New York City… easier said than done. That is when the best plan B ever presented itself, The Disney College Program at Walt Disney World. What could go wrong? Florida, sunshine, princesses, and I would get paid… the decision was made for me in that moment. Now, I had not been to Disney World since 1994 so I wasn’t quite sure what I was getting myself into or that my inner Disney girl was trying to escape.
   </p></article>

   <article><p>
   In May of 2011, just a week after graduation, I packed the trunk of my yellow car full of my belongings and made the drive to Florida. I didn’t know a soul or that I was about to work harder than I ever had in my life but being my bubbly self I was going to force people to be my friend and kill them with kindness (some of you reading this were victims of this and yet you still want to be around me! #winning). I showed up in business casual like the instructions stated for my last orientation class and sat down at the first table of somewhat normal looking people (those of you that know Disney know that there is a special breed of people who work there). One of the “normals” happened to be Steve. However, Steve would not even look up from his iPhone to say hi as I sat down as he was playing some streak for the cash game, or whatever it is called. Supposedly, Steve saw me coming to the table and thought I looked like a preppy brat with my pencil skirt and Vera Bradley tote… yep we were off to a great start. Within the first hour Steve realized Disney folks are weird and I believe it or not was the only normal person at the table. As we walked around Downtown Disney (because it will never be Disney Springs) on our tour he actually talked to me and even offered to go to Magic Kingdom with me later that day. After arriving back at home, I realized neither of us had exchanged information. So like a typical girl I Facebook stalked him. At one point during the day he had asked me to look at something on his schedule and his name was not that hard to remember so I’m not sure it’s actually called stalking. He somehow still agreed to go to Magic Kingdom but, this meet up almost did not occur. As I am sitting on the bus, he was on the phone at his stop with our future roommate Jim. Steve did not see the bus and almost didn’t make it on. So as you can see already we are still not off to a great start. During this first meet up we did not go on a single ride because I cannot make a decision to save my life. But we did get to watch the firework show “Wishes” for the first time together. I sat on the floor like a five year old in awe while Steve wondered why he was still there.
</p></article>

<article><p>
About a month later I convinced him or maybe he convinced me to go on our first date. By the way, once you do dates at Disney not much can top that. Steve planned an epic full day date in Italy...at Epcot- from rides to food to fireworks to drinks at the dueling piano bar. He sure set the bar high.
</p></article>

<article><p>
Over the next 6 months Steve and I both worked like crazy, played in the parks, traveled to Sanibel Island, Clearwater beach, and had many late night meals.
</p></article>

<article><p>
In January 2012, our internship had come to an end. Steve was heading back to Penn State to finish his undergrad degree and I was heading to the dreaded Minnesota to live with mom and dad and attempt to figure out my life. After just 2 short months back at home  I was finally moving to New York City for my first big kid job. It seemed like a dream come true but was short lived. By fall 2012 I had packed up and moved down to Penn State and started a whirlwind of multiple jobs and no sleep while Steve geared up for graduation. When he graduated in December he moved back to Philadelphia for a job with Lockheed Martin. I stayed in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania for almost 2 years. At least once a month we would drive the four hours between the two cities. We had our ups and downs, we went on our first cruise together and visited our first international destination. 
</p></article>

<article><p>
In the fall of 2014, I finally made the move down to Philadelphia where I moved into the house Steve was renting with his friends Jim and Justin. Living with 3 guys was interesting to say the least but they sure did keep me on my toes. 
</p></article>

<article><p>
By the end of 2015 Steve had finally scored his covitted transfer back down to Orlando. So we packed up our bags (mine about 4 months later than his) and moved back to the place where it all began. I had no job and no idea what to do with my life but all things tend to lead back to Disney. Almost two years and three Disney jobs later we are at the part you are probably all waiting for... the proposal. 
</p></article>

<article><p>
I did not see the proposal coming at all since I am pretty much oblivious to everything. The week of our trip to Disneyland turned out to be the worst travel week thanks to Hurricane Irma. Our friends we were traveling with were already safely on the West Coast in Portland. Steve was in process of rerouting from a previous trip in Philly. And I was the lone memebr of our trip stuck in Orlando. After searching every airline, changing flights multiple times, and finally just paying for a new flight I was all set to leave Orlando a day earlier than planned, even through i kept telling everyone i would be fine riding out the hurricane and it was not worth the trouble. On Monday, September 11th, Steve was acting oddly but I thought nothing of it. I told Chad around lunch that Steve only acts like this when he is hurt or sick. So my first instinct was to buy him a pair of socks to make him cheer up. If you have met Steve you know he has quite the sock collection and he will plan full outfits around them. While the socks may have cheered him up for a moment it didn’t last. I ventured off on my own to practice using my new camera while the rest of the group took a break before the next show we were attending. During my solo adventure they were actually finalizing proposal plans. When I returned to the group they told me they had managed to score a tour of Walt Disney’s apartment because of a connection Chad and Megan had. I was super excited as this is usually only for VIP clients but still had no clue.
</p></article>

<article><p>
 When we got into the apartment we were given a tour and were told our guide had been given approval to lift the photo ban and take a group picture for us. Chad dragged Megan up to the front of the room for practice pictures so I could show our guide how to use the camera. He at that point decided it was only fair to get a couple picture of Steve and I too. When I tried to walk away Steve asked for one more picture, which he never does as he usually tries to be free of picture taking as soon as possible. Steve handed me a small Disney gift bag… I think he expected me to open it but I thought we were taking pictures so I tried to put it down. When he finally got me to open it I saw a pin with a bride and groom Mickey and Minnie on it. As the story goes, when we first met one of my stores sold pins. I had shown him a pin I thought was really pretty (a marriage pin) but told him it would be crazy to buy it at that point in my life. Steve may not have found the exact pin but the meaning behind it was apparent. Steve started to tell the story of the pin and forgot everything he had planned to say. As he got down on one knee in the middle of Walt Disney’s apartment I just uttered what are you doing about a million times. As Chad would later tell me I eventually handed him the wrong hand and somehow said yes or nodded like a fool- it really is all a blur. It didn’t hit me until much later what had finally happened. When we arrived back to the concierge level of our hotel they presented us with cake, champagne and balloons. Suddenly it dawned on me that I was engaged. Because apparently being asked if you want to marry someone, saying yes, and wearing a ring isn’t enough right? But then again... emotions have never been my strong suit. 
</p></article>

<article><p>
So this is where we are in our story… We have just moved into our new house where we are beginning to plan our Best Day Ever... Happily Ever After coming to you February 2019.
</p></article>

<article><p>
P.S. for those of you keeping track yes this story spans across 5 states, 4 periods of long distance relationship, 9 moves and over 2555 days. :)
